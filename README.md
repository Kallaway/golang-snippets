Bits, pieces and examples of Golang code

I am posting them here as I go, most of them can be run from their respective little folders.

Please let me know here or on Twitter [@ka11away](https://twitter.com/ka11away) if you'd like more example on specific topics.
For example: structs, interfaces, variables, types, etc. :)
